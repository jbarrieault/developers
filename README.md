# PCO Third Party Developer Support

## Authentication

[Planning Center Services](http://services.planningcenteronline.com) uses [OAuth 1.0](http://oauth.net/core/1.0) to allow users to log in through third-party applications. OAuth can be tricky if you are new to it, but we have example applications below to get you started.

Before integrating your app with PCO, you'll need to request API keys by emailing [support](mailto:support@planningcenteronline.com). Be sure to include a URL for your app or church in your request.

## Example Applications

- [Ruby](/examples/ruby)
- [PHP (PECL Library)](/examples/php-pecl) - The easiest way to do OAuth with PHP if you have the ability to install PECL extensions (or if it has already been installed).
- [PHP (OAuth Library)](/examples/php-library) - Uses an OAuth library that can be required from your script. This library is more complicated to use, but it works if you are unable to use the prefered PECL method.

## Support

If you have any questions or feature requests, post them in the [issues](/ministrycentered/developers/issues) section of this repository and one of our developers will respond to you shortly.
