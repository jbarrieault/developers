# Planning Center Online Third Party Developer Support

## Authentication

[Planning Center Services](http://services.planningcenteronline.com) uses [OAuth 1.0](http://oauth.net/core/1.0) to allow users to log in through third-party applications. OAuth can be tricky if you are new to it, but we have example applications below to get you started.

Before integrating your app with PCO, you'll need to request API keys by emailing [support](mailto:support@planningcenteronline.com). Be sure to include a URL for your app or church in your request.

## Example Applications

- [Ruby](/example/ruby)
- [PHP](/examples/php)

## Support

If you have any questions or feature requests, post them in the [issues](/ministrycentered/developers/issues) section of this repository and one of our developers will respond to you shortly.
