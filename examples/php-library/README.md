# PHP OAuth Library Example

If you are not able to do use the [OAuth PECL](/examples/php-pecl) extenstion you can use this library. It is more complicated to use, but easier to install.

## Setup

Set your consumer key, consumer secret and callback url in `oauth_config.php`. (You can get a consumer key and secret by emailing (support)[mailto:support@plannincenteronline.com]). The callback url should be a full url (not just a path) to the location of the code in `callback.php`.

Now visit `index.php`. Tada!
